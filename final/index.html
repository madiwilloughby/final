<h1>The Purple Zone Pipeline: how to eat allergy-friendly at UMD’s dining halls</h1>

<div class="large-9 cell">
<p>Growing up, sophomore piano performance major Julia Hananel remembers sitting awkwardly at her friends’ birthday parties while they ate pizza and cake that she could not eat because of celiac disease.</p>
<p>Years later, she toured colleges with the stress in the back of her mind that the school she chose would not be able to accommodate her restrictions. She said she gravitated towards bigger schools because she had more confidence that they would not put her at risk because of their food choices.</p>
<p>“I’ll never not be paranoid a little bit when I eat out just because I’ve been burned so many times,” Hananel said.</p>
<p>About 7% to 11% of college-aged people have food allergies and because they are younger they are more likely to have life-threatening reactions, <a href="https://www.uptodate.com/contents/food-allergy-in-college-and-university-students-overview-and-management" target="_blank">according to Up to Date.</a> These years are also often the first time students are responsible for their own meals, which can cause a lot of stress, especially in those with more severe allergies.</p>
<p>Nutritionist and Quality Coordinator Sister Maureen C Shrimpe is a certified allergen trainer and said that 200 of the Dining Services staff members are allergen certified. Shrimpe said that Dining Services makes its best effort to work with students that have allergies.</p>
<p>“So many times, like now, they’re saying ‘well, I haven’t been able to eat anything for the whole year,’” Shrimpe said. “It’s so important that they really communicate with us.</p>
<p>All the food items in the dining halls at the university are marked with icons to show which allergens are in each of the items. For example, some of the stickers indicate if something contains meat, nuts, dairy and more.</p>
<p>To respond to these students’ needs, Dining Services has also created designated areas that serve food that does not contain or come into contact with the nine most common allergens: dairy, peanuts, tree nuts, eggs, sesame, soy, fish, gluten and shellfish, <a href="https://dining.umd.edu/services/students/allergies-intolerances-and-special-diets" target="_blank">according to their website.</a></p>
<p>These stations are called the Purple Zones, and are found in the 251 North and South Campus Dining Halls. Shrimpe said that these zones are self-contained and none of the listed allergens come into contact with them.</p>
<p>Purple freezers, stocked with snacks from popular allergy conscious brands like Udi’s, Amy’s, Daiya and Enjoy Life, are also in each of the dining halls. Not all the items are free of the nine main allergens, but they are all marked to indicate which allergens are not in them.</p>
<p>If students have enough allergies that they cannot eat these options, Dining Services will work with students to make meals that work for them. Shrimpe said that these students can order their meals to pick up at the kitchen entrances of the dining halls; this is to ensure that no other food comes into contact with them.</p>
<p>Shrimpe said she hopes that students are aware of the options that Dining Services provides and wants to make sure that their needs are met. Students can also submit the <a href="https://dining.umd.edu/form/allergy" target="_blank">Allergies and Food Intolerances Form</a> on the Dining Services website to inform them of their allergies.</p>
<p>Hananel said that she has never gotten sick from the food from the dining hall and is grateful for the extra options. However, she also said that the options at the Purple Zones can get repetitive. There are new foods at the Purple Zones for each meal of the day and the meals repeat every four weeks, according to the site.</p>
<p>Hananel was excited to live in a dorm with a kitchen because she found she was eating the same meal often, usually chickpea pasta. She has gotten more passionate about cooking and said that it has been a “game changer” throughout her college experience.</p>
<p>Sophomore government and politics major Julia Cicero said that her allergies sometimes make it difficult to eat in the dining hall. While not as extreme as some other cases, she has found it hard to avoid tree nuts, mangoes, apples and carrots also beyond the dining halls.</p>
<p>She does not have to eat food from the Purple Zones, but still gets anxious that she will accidentally eat something she will react to. She opted for a smaller dining plan this year so she can have more control over the food she eats.</p>
<p>Shrimpe understands this anxiety, and said she encourages students to always talk to Dining Services staff members if something that they are given does not look right to them. She said she wants students to feel comfortable, adding that they can always ask staff members to change their gloves or utensils.</p>
<p>“I would say we really try to go the extra mile to help them,” Shrimpe said.</p>
